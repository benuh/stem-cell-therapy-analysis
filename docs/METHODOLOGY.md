   ```
   Primary Endpoint: Time to treatment failure
   Methods:
   - Cox Proportional Hazards models
   - Kaplan-Meier survival curves
   - Accelerated failure time models
   Covariates: Age, disease duration, baseline severity, treatment protocol
   ```

2. **Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling**
   ```
   Hierarchy: Country ‚Üí Institution ‚Üí Patient
   Prior Distribution: Non-informative priors for exploratory analysis
   MCMC Sampling: 4 chains, 2000 iterations, Rhat < 1.1
   Model Comparison: WAIC and LOO cross-validation
   ```

3. **Meta-Analysis Framework**
   ```
   Fixed Effects: Treatment effect estimation
   Random Effects: Between-study heterogeneity
   Subgroup Analysis: By treatment type, population, geography
   Publication Bias: Funnel plots, Egger's test
   ```

### Phase 3: Machine Learning Pipeline
**Objective**: Build AI models for outcome prediction and patient stratification

**ML Methodology**:

1. **Feature Engineering**
   ```python
   # Clinical Features
   - Demographics: age, gender, BMI, comorbidities
   - Disease characteristics: duration, severity scores, biomarkers
   - Treatment variables: cell type, dose, delivery method, timing

   # Temporal Features
   - Disease progression rates
   - Treatment response trajectories
   - Time-dependent covariates

   # Interaction Features
   - Treatment √ó patient characteristic interactions
   - Non-linear transformations
   - Principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction
   ```

2. **Model Development**
   ```python
   # Ensemble Approach
   Models = [
       RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=1000, max_depth=10),
       XGBClassifier(learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=6),
       LGBMClassifier(num_leaves=31, learning_rate=0.05),
       CatBoostClassifier(iterations=1000, depth=6)
   ]

   # Neural Network Architecture
   - Input layer: standardized clinical features
   - Hidden layers: [256, 128, 64] with dropout (0.3)
   - Output layer: sigmoid (binary) or softmax (multiclass)
   - Optimization: Adam with learning rate scheduling
   ```

3. **Validation Strategy**
   ```python
   # Cross-Validation
   - Time-based splits to avoid data leakage
   - Stratified sampling by outcome and treatment type
   - 5-fold cross-validation with temporal ordering

   # External Validation
   - Hold-out recent trials (2023-2025) for final testing
   - Geographic validation: train on US/EU, test on other regions
   - Institution-level validation for generalizability
   ```

### Phase 4: Operational Research & Optimization
**Objective**: Optimize treatment protocols using mathematical optimization

**Optimization Framework**:

1. **Multi-Objective Optimization**
   ```python
   # Objective Functions
   maximize: treatment_efficacy(protocol)
   maximize: patient_safety(protocol)
   minimize: treatment_cost(protocol)
   minimize: time_to_response(protocol)

   # Constraints
   - Regulatory approval requirements
   - Resource availability (cells, facilities, staff)
   - Patient eligibility criteria
   - Safety thresholds
   ```

2. **Resource Allocation Models**
   ```python
   # Linear Programming Formulation
   Decision Variables:
   - x_ij = number of patients of type i assigned to treatment j
   - y_k = whether facility k is activated

   Constraints:
   - Capacity constraints per facility
   - Patient demand satisfaction
   - Budget limitations
   - Quality standards maintenance
   ```

3. **Treatment Protocol Optimization**
   ```python
   # Genetic Algorithm Implementation
   Chromosome = [cell_dose, delivery_method, timing, follow_up_schedule]
   Fitness = weighted_sum(efficacy, safety, cost, duration)

   Operators:
   - Selection: tournament selection
   - Crossover: uniform crossover with clinical constraints
   - Mutation: gaussian mutation within feasible ranges
   ```
